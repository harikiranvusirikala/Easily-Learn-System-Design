1• Domain Name System(DNS)
	• Name servers: respond to users’ queries.
	• Resource records(RR): form of domain name to IP address mappings.
	• Caching:
	• Hierarchy: allows DNS to be highly scalable

	• DNS hierarchy
		• Types
			• DNS resolver / local or default servers: initiate the querying sequence and forward requests to the other DNS name servers
			• Root-level name servers: receive requests from local servers, return a list of top-level domain (TLD) servers that hold the IP addresses of the .xyz domain
			• Top-level domain (TLD) name servers: hold the IP addresses of authoritative name servers.
			• Authoritative name servers: organization’s DNS name servers that provide the IP addresses of the web or application servers
		• Ways
			• Iterative: local server requests the root, TLD, and the authoritative servers for the IP address
			• Recursive
	• DNS as a distributed system
		• Highly scalable
		• Reliable
			• Caching: in the browser, operating systems, local name server within the user’s network, or the ISP’s DNS resolvers
			• Server replication
			• Protocol: many rely on unreliable User Datagram Protocol (UDP) which is faster
		• Consistent: eventual consistency as many reads compared to writes
	• Test it out
		• The nslookup output
		• The dig output
